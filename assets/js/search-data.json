            "content": "Amateur Investor . I am not what one would call a seasoned investor, infact, I am quite the opposite. . The stock market has always been something that I heard about, yet I never had never quite delve into it. I am still a child when it comes to anything related to stocks or the stock market. My first experience was in my senior year of high school as I played simulations of the market, investing all of my money into the large companies that everyone talks about (Tesla, Meta, Google, so on.) However, the acqusition and management of said stocks were something that I never attached myself to, as they had no actual monitary value. Each buy order I made never really had no structure to them, as I made impulsive purchases or based all of my purchases off the green numbers and upward trends. As you can probably tell, I did not do so well, as my portfolio closed at nearly 40% of its original value. . Although my first experience with the stock market may not have been the best, it served as great stepping stone. Being able to explore the ins and outs of the stock market still have an impact on me to this day. The concepts of selling and buying never really would have cemented in my knowledge if it was not for the stock market game. However, knowing when to do so is still a challenge. . Analyzing graphs and reading patterns is something that can be done easily, as we can use mathematics to calculate potential futures. However, in the case of stocks, that is an entirely different story. Whenever I talk to people regarding stocks, I am told to monitor news, trends, as well as statistics based on the stock I am interested in. Yes, taking notes of stocks is pretty helpful, however, knowing when to buy or sell is entirely different. How is one supposed to predict the perfect time to sell or buy? . As I know it, stocks are based on decisions made by companies, government influence (economy), or other factors that impact a certain company that may reflect on their stock value. However knowing when these decisions may affect the stock is something that unpredictable. In addition to this, stock traders are another factor that are entirely unpredictable. Constant fluxuations in the stock market are something that I know occur on a daily basis, however, somehow knowing when to purchase a stock or selling it is a task that is incomprehensible (or maybe just a ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù that I still have not acquired yet.) . Moving on to the topic of shorting‚Ä¶ Shorting, shorting, why do you exist‚Ä¶ The concept of shorting was never something that I grasped entirely. As Investopedia puts it: . Short selling occurs when an investor borrows a security and sells it on the open market, planning to buy it back later for less money. Short-sellers bet on, and profit from, a drop in a security‚Äôs price. (Investopedia) . It baffles me why someone would allow someone take a share of their stock, betting, hoping that it would go down (I will return to this topic later in this blog.) Shorting, to me and many others (I am sure of) sounds unethical in its entirety. Yes there may be some benefits like . provide liquidity and price discovery to a market, making it more efficient (Investopedia) . but the ethcicity of the whole concept, in my opinion, overpowers the benefits. The closest thing that I can think of that could relate to the concept of shorting a stock is like how a superhero would offer themselves up to a villain and see the world burn as only the villain benefits; which does not make any sense. Don‚Äôt people want to see the upsides, rather than the down? I dont get it‚Ä¶ . There is still I do not know about the stock market and/or stocks so, yes, I‚Äôm an amateur. üëç .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a ‚Äúlevel 1 heading‚Äù in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting .
