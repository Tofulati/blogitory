            "content": "By no means am I an experienced investor or someone fully understands the stock market. Please read with discretion. . :‚Äì: Purple representing S&amp;P 500 and Blue representing DOW Jones . The August and September stock market sessions have been on the low. All across the board, red. The S&amp;P 500 dropped nearly 15%[^1] and the DOW Jones Industrial Average dropping nearly 13%[^1] from their peaks around August 16th. Despite these drops, there were multiple occasions where the markets gained (as it usually fluxuates.) However, the most prominent of these gains was within the week of August 6th to 12th as the S&amp;P 500 increased with a ~5% gain and DOW Jones Industrial Average with an increase of ~4% gain. Although this period of time was a sigh of relief for investors, the stock market changed course and plunged. Though there are multiple factors to blame, one of the most prominent would be due to FED price hikes. . As mentioned in Forbes Advisor post on September 23, 2022, ‚ÄúWhy Is The Stock Market Down Today?‚Äù subsection ‚ÄúThe Fed Is Getting What It Asked For‚Äù: . Ahead of this week‚Äôs Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) meeting, The Wall Street Journal reported that Fed officials had been pretty unhappy with the market‚Äôs &gt;positive reaction following the July rate hike. . Between the July decision and mid-August, the S&amp;P 500 gained 10%‚Äîeven though Fed Chair Jerome Powell went out of his way to underline that the Fed was committed to &gt;its campaign to crush inflation. The stock market, it appears, didn‚Äôt take the hint. . Powell‚Äôs displeasure with the rally was so intense that he discarded his prepared speech for the August Jackson Hole conference in favor of a ‚Äúdirect and forceful &gt;message‚Äù that the Fed would do whatever it takes to suppress rising inflation. . ‚ÄúWithout price stability, the economy does not work for anyone,‚Äù Powell said during his speech last month in Jackson Hole. ‚ÄúReducing inflation is likely to require a &gt;sustained period of below-trend growth.‚Äù . The market rally had already stalled out by the time Powell was lecturing the markets in Montana. His blunt remarks underscored that the interest rate hikes would not &gt;end soon and that the Fed was prepared to slow the economy, if necessary, to kill inflation. . Underscoring the point, the August consumer price index (CPI) report, released in mid-September, showed that inflation is barely cooling off in the U.S. CPI remained &gt;higher in August, up 8.3% year over year‚Äîanalysts had expected the figure to drop to at least 8%. (Forbes) . From the point of view of Fed officials, enforcing another price hike seem justified, as ‚Äúinflation‚Äù seemed to be on the rise. In decreasing the prices, there would be an increase in consumer spending, however the effects of this decrease are detrimental. . An Amateur‚Äôs POV . As mentioned in my previous blog, the stock market is something that I am fairly new to. However, entering at this period of time as one that was quite a rollercoaster ride as I experienced the front lines of stock market plunges. Though there are multiple factors that may have influenced this decrease (in my journey specifically,) red is all I see. Nike for example, is a great example of this plunge. . Looking back, NKE (Nike) seemed like a great idea as previous years showed promise. . :‚Äì: . As someone that actively browses Nike, purchasing NKE within the fourth quarter was something that quite appealing. Within the month of October, Nike has been known to release new shoes as people flock to stores in hopes of securing new shoes. Comparing the times of these releases with previous years of NKE stock, there was a similar relationship between the two. Though there may have been other factors that resulted in this increase, increases in the stock that happened to be around there is a new release is quite a coincidence. . As of writing this, calling the shots on the future of this stock seem a little idiotic, however, the current state of NKE is in shambles. Looking at the beginning of year, the stock has been on a steady fall. . . Nearly dropping ~50% from its peak in November 15th of last year, the stock has been dropping ever since. Looking forwards to the earnings report day (September 29th,) all we can hope for is an increase in earnings compared to last year. . Looking at the stock market now, I have still have plenty to learn. Recognizing patterns and fully understanding the ins and outs of the stock market are still something that I continue to work on. Despite the drawbacks of losing money on my first year in the market, this plunge offers me opportunities for what to watch out for. Although it is still too early to finalize any thoughts, I hope to stock market makes a recovery‚Ä¶ . . Or maybe not. . :‚Äì: [^1]As of writting this blog, September 25th, 2022 .",

            "title": "Amateur Investor",
            "content": "I am not what one would call a seasoned investor, infact, I am quite the opposite. . The stock market has always been something that I heard about, yet I never had never quite delve into it. I am still a child when it comes to anything related to stocks or the stock market. My first experience was in my senior year of high school as I played simulations of the market, investing all of my money into the large companies that everyone talks about (Tesla, Meta, Google, so on.) However, the acqusition and management of said stocks were something that I never attached myself to, as they had no actual monitary value. Each buy order I made never really had no structure to them, as I made impulsive purchases or based all of my purchases off the green numbers and upward trends. As you can probably tell, I did not do so well, as my portfolio closed at nearly 40% of its original value. . Although my first experience with the stock market may not have been the best, it served as great stepping stone. Being able to explore the ins and outs of the stock market still have an impact on me to this day. The concepts of selling and buying never really would have cemented in my knowledge if it was not for the stock market game. However, knowing when to do so is still a challenge. . Analyzing graphs and reading patterns is something that can be done easily, as we can use mathematics to calculate potential futures. However, in the case of stocks, that is an entirely different story. Whenever I talk to people regarding stocks, I am told to monitor news, trends, as well as statistics based on the stock I am interested in. Yes, taking notes of stocks is pretty helpful, however, knowing when to buy or sell is entirely different. How is one supposed to predict the perfect time to sell or buy? . As I know it, stocks are based on decisions made by companies, government influence (economy), or other factors that impact a certain company that may reflect on their stock value. However knowing when these decisions may affect the stock is something that unpredictable. In addition to this, stock traders are another factor that are entirely unpredictable. Constant fluxuations in the stock market are something that I know occur on a daily basis, however, somehow knowing when to purchase a stock or selling it is a task that is incomprehensible (or maybe just a ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù that I still have not acquired yet.) . Moving on to the topic of shorting‚Ä¶ Shorting, shorting, why do you exist‚Ä¶ The concept of shorting was never something that I grasped entirely. As Investopedia puts it: . Short selling occurs when an investor borrows a security and sells it on the open market, planning to buy it back later for less money. Short-sellers bet on, and profit from, a drop in a security‚Äôs price. (Investopedia) . It baffles me why someone would allow someone take a share of their stock, betting that it would go down. Like why would you let someone do this?? You are literally letting people borrow a share of your stocks and let them earn off of it, by hoping it would go down. Im sure, to me and many others, shorting sounds unethical in its entirety. Although there are some unethical parts of shorting, there may be some benefits like . provide liquidity and price discovery to a market, making it more efficient (Investopedia) . but the ethcicity of the whole concept, in my opinion, overpowers the benefits. I know this is sort of controversial as there are many people that have benefited off shorting, but how is this legal? The closest thing that I can think of that could relate to the concept of shorting a stock is like how a superhero would offer themselves up to a villain and see the world burn as only the villain benefits; which does not make any sense. Don‚Äôt people want to see the upsides, rather than the down? I dont get it‚Ä¶ . There is still I do not know about the stock market and/or stocks so, yes, I‚Äôm an amateur. üë∂üíµ .",
