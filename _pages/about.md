<div style="text-align: center">I am currently a freshman undergraduate majoring in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California, Merced.
As of right now, I have experience with Java, Python, and some in HTML however, I am still working on improving my skills. I have interests
in stocks, music (mostly KPOP and KRNB), piano, and anything programming related (as I want to expand my horizons in coding or 
anything computer science related.) Although I am not the most proficient in coding, I hope that in creating this blog page,
I am able to connect with others and hone my web dev. Please feel free to contact me through social media if you have any inquiries about my page
or any topics that you found interesting! I would love to hear your perspective!</div>
